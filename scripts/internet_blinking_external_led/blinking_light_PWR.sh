# The same as above can be done with pinctrl, however, from my understanding this access the
# pins directly and could potentially be harmful because of this
#
# This is what is stated at the beginning when doing `pinctrl help`:
# > WARNING! pinctrl set writes directly to the GPIO control registers
# > ignoring whatever else may be using them (such as Linux drivers) -
# > it is designed as a debug tool, only use it if you know what you
